Using the Native Tracing Agent on a Long Running Process with config-write-period-secs

You can run the demo by executing the following commands after cloning the repository:

```bash
./mvnw package
./mvnw exec:exec@run-with-tracing
``` 

Examine the `target/native-image-config` directory while the application is running to see the configuration files being generated by the tracing agent.
The number of folders just keeps growing and growing.

CTRL-C to stop the application when you are done observing the tracing agent in action.
